    Office hour, 
        going over planted errors in the project manager 

                app.use(
                cors({
                    credentials: true,
                    origin: "http://localhost:3000",
                })
                );
    
        May be useful if having issues getting code to be accepted from the front end to the back end. 


        good way to test out if your server is even working/accepting routes, use your Postman 


    Lecture

        you can wrap your browser router in your index.js

        use the key in the table for the Id of the player 

            <tr key={player._id}

        you can link the bootstrap cdn in the index.html
