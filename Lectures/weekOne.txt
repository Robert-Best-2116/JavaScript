    What is a full stack application?

        Combination of front end, back end and database, takes information from the front end, passes it to the back end, then the back end passes it to the database, database tells the back end it worked, and the process continues

        In this stack well be running two servers, a front end client server, and then a backend server. unlike python and java, where it was just one server for the backend.
