Deployment 

    Push your code to github

        Before you get started we need to get the project onto GitHub. Change directory into the project folder that contains your client and server folders 

        Inside of this folder, we will be making a file called .gitignore. The .gitignore file will allow us to tell git which files and folders we don't want to commit. As the contents of our node_modules folders are rather large and can be easily re-downloaded, we will be making sure these don't get pushed to GitHub.

            echo node_modules/ > .gitignore

        This command will create a file called .gitignore and make its contents the text node_modules/ 

        Open up the .gitignore file and add the following lines 

            /node_modules
            /coverage
            /build
            .DS_Store 
            .env 

        Next, we will need to remove any git repositories that already exist inside of our client folder. When we run the npx create-react-app client command, it will automatically add in a git repo by default, and beings we wish to push all of our project to github as one repository, we will need to remove this now. Change the directory from your project folder into the client folder and remove the hidden .git folder using one of the following methods 

            rm -rf .git
            rm .gitignore

        Next we will initialize a git repository in our project level folder, add all of our code to it, and create a commit with the message "initial commit" 

            inside of your Parent Folder 

                git init 
                git add * 
                git commit -m"initial commit"

        Next we need to create a GitHub repository . After logging into GitHub, click on the repositories tab followed by the green button that says "New 

        Next time in your new repository name "MERN-Deployment" works well and click on the "Create repository" button. Note- This guide will refer to your repo as "MERN Deployment". You can replace it with whatever. 

        You can choose to make this repo private if you would like. This process does not require it to be public. Next we will set the remote origin for our project repo on your computer and then push our code up to it. 

            git remote add origin https://github.com/your_github_username/MERN-deployment.git
            git branch -M main
            git push -u origin main

        The project is now on github 

    Set Up your server instance on AWS 

        To get started, login to AWS. Search for the EC2 Dashboard, click on "Instances". To create the new instance select the "Launch Instances" button in the upper right portion of the screen. 

        The first thing you will need to do is choose your server, you want Amazon Machine Image. We will need to select our AMI type, which is UBUNTU. We want to choose version 20.04 LTS, we are choosing this one because it supports MongoDB while 22.04 does not. 

        Select instance type t2.micro, it is the largest instance that is still Free tier eligible. Again, we will want to pick the smallest server possible so that we are not charged. 

        Next we will configure the key pair, this will allow me to connect to my instance as an admin. This key can not be shared. Never, meaning NEVER upload your PEM key to a git repo, or put it in a public place on the internet. This is a literal key to access our instance, and misplacing it can potentially allow bad actors to install malicious software, Always store your PEM keys in a safe local folder. 

        Name your key pair, ideally after your project, set the types to RSA and .pem 

        Next we will configure our security group. We want to limit the amount of computers that can access our server through SSH, so we recommend that you set your SSH traffic to My IP. If you are on a public wifi or you change your locations regularly, your IP address will change. If you are having trouble using SSH, please confirm that your IP address is yours. 

        We will also want to enable all HTTPS and HTTP traffic. After all this is a server. 

        Next, we are going to configure our storage, click advanced to see the drop down menu.  we will want to make sure we stay in Free Tier eligible 

        You can now Launch your instance and return to the dashboard. 

Connecting your database 

    After clicking on "Launch Instances" you will see a message showing the "Launch Status". Click on "View Instances" and you will see your instance in your "Instances" web page. It quickly shows as "Running" 

    If you choose to name your instance, hover your mouse over the "-" and select the edit button and give it a name to make it easy to identify in the future. 

    Select your instance and click the connect Button. The new page will show you the SSH (security shell) connection information that is specific to your instance.

    In your terminal, cd into the directory hat contains your pem key. Once there run the commands from the modal on the EC2 dashboard. The first command will properly set the permissions for a key name keyname.pem, the second will SSH into your AWS server instance. 

        Note-In Windows CMD you do not need to run the chmond command. 

    If you are promoted that the authenticity of the host cannot be established, type the word "yes" to continue. You should now be connected to your server instance. 

Getting our code onto the server instance 

    There are a few steps we need to take initially getting everything set up

        sudo apt update 
        sudo apt install nodejs nginx git ca-certificates -y 

    These commands will make sure the server has up to date software, then install: Node.js, Node Package Manager, NGINX (pronounced "engine x") and git. the "-y" answers yes to the prompt if you want to install all of this software. 

Node Version 

    By default, we will get getting version 8.10.0 when we install nodejs, and we need to get a more recent version for many our of packages to run happily on the server. To overcome this we will install a PPA (Personal Package Archive) that will allow us to get a newer version of nodejs. 

        nodejs -v
        # this should print out version 10.19.0
        curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
        sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
        sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
        node -v
        # this should now print out version 14.7.0 or newer
        sudo apt install build-essential

    Now that we have installed NGINX (our server software), we should be able to navigate to our browser to our server's public IP address and see the default NGINX splash screen. 

        Important if you do not see the Welcome to NGINX message you either did not install NGINX in the previous step, your url is trying to connect using secure http (https) or you did not set up your Security Group correctly. Start by verifying your URL begins with HTTP:// and then the nginx service is running by using the command service nginx status. 

    Now that we have installed git, we can use it to close our repository that we made in the first step. 

        git clone https://github.com/your_github_username/MERN-deployment.git

    Next we will export a variable on our server. We do this to make things simpler. 

        export repoName=MERN-Deployment

    After exporting the variable, we can check to make sure it was set by echoing it. Echo will print the variable out in our terminal. 

        echo $repoName 

    When referring to our variable "repoName" moving forward we will have a $ at the beginning of it. 


Setting Up the Front End 

    Next we'll cd into the client folder and then delete a folder at /var/www/html. This is where the hmtl from eariler "welcome to ngix spash screen lives. We are then going to move the folder production react app code that we built before pushing the code to github to this folder. lastly well restar tthe nginx service so that it no longer serves the previous welcome message 

        cd ~/$repoName/client
        npm install
        npm run build
        sudo rm -rf /var/www/html 
        sudo mv build /var/www/html
        sudo service nginx restart

    If we navigate our browser to our IP address we should see the front end of our project rather than the default NGINX splash screen. If you dont see this go back and try rerunning the previous steps. 

    Fixing our front end routes 

        When we were developing before, our back-end server was accessible on "http:localhost:8000" but when we deploy our project the back-end will then be accessible at whatever our IP address happens to be. To fix the links we would essentially need to go into our build folder and change all routes that look like this into routes that start with "/" while we could fire vim and do just that we can instead use the power of bash commands to make this change in one command. 

            sudo grep -rl localhost /var/www/html | xargs sed -i 's/http:\/\/localhost:8000//g'

        Important! if your back-end server runs on a port other than 800 change the command above to use that. 

        This command will use grep to find all lines that contain the string, "localHost in our build files and pipe them into SED which will do a find and replace to remove the matching string and leave it with our needed "/" 

    Setting up the Back-end 

        next we need to retrieve the node_modules that we previously gitignored. 

            cd ~/$repoName/server
            npm i

        Next we need to get our back-end server working. 

        First thing we need is a working MongoDB 

            Note these commands are very long so each new command is prefaced by a $ dont add the $ 

                $ wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.2.asc | sudo apt-key add -
                $ echo "deb [ arch=amd64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/4.2 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.2.list
                $ sudo apt update
                $ sudo apt install -y mongodb-org
                $ sudo service mongod start
                $ service mongod status

            These commands will install mongoDb, start the mongoDB daemon, and display the daemons status, You should see a message that looks like the following letting you know its working! 

    Next we will configure the NGINX 

        The following commands will delete the old NGINX configuration and open the file in vim for us to copy in our new configuration 

            sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
            sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
        
        Once inside the vim, use i to go into insert mode and then copy and paste the following text 

            # MERN-Deployment Configuration 1-16-2020
            server {
                listen 80 default_server;
                listen [::]:80 default_server;
                root /var/www/html;
                index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
                server_name MERN-Deployment;
                location /api {
                    proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
                    proxy_http_version 1.1;
                    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
                    proxy_set_header Host $host;
                    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;    
                }
                location / {
                    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
                }
                error_page 404 /index.html;
            }

        After pasting this configuration you can escape vim by using esc followed by :wd and then enter 

        This configuration will point all request that start with /api to our backend and will respond to every other request with our index.html file. 

        now that we have set up the configuration we can test to see if the back-end is now connecting, 

            cd ~/$repoName/server       <--  you should already be in this folder if you followed this tutorial
            sudo service nginx restart
            node server.js

        At this point our project should be working as long as the node server.js command is running 

    Wrapping up 

        Our project is working, but as soon as we disconnect from the server instance, our project will stop running. What we need is a process manager to keep our back-end running. Enter pm2, PM2 is a  project manager for node.js applications. 

        Stop the currently running node server and start your server.js using the pm2 process manager with the following commands. 

            sudo npm i pm2 -g
            pm2 start server.js
            pm2 status

        These command will install pm2 globally, tell pm2 to run server.js for us and display the status of pm2. 

        at this point if the status says online your finished!!!!!! 

Updating your code and refreshing your installation:

    If you find a bug and want to fix it, or just add some fun extras so you can show off to friends. 

        update your code and test it on your local computer 
        stage and commit your code to your git repo using the command line or your vs code editors. 
        push the changes to github: git push 

    connect via SSH to your instance as described above. 

        change directory into your project folder. cd ~/MERN-Deployment

        stop the pm2 process daemon pm2 stop all 

            this should stop the express/node server

        pull the recent changes from github using git pull 

        change directory into the client folder cd client 

        build the react app run npm run build 

        stop the currently running nginx process 

            sudo service nginx stop
            sudo service nginx status 

        replace the running react app and remember to update the URLs using grep and sed. 

            sudo rm -rf /var/www/html
            sudo mv build /var/www/html
            sudo grep -rl localhost /var/www/html | xargs sed -i 's/http:\/\/localhost:8000//g'

        Restart the PM@ process : 

            pm2 restart all 

            this should restart your express/node server 

        restart the react app 

            sudo service nginx restart

            sudo service nginx status 

    to view the server logs while using pm2 run the following command 

        sudo pm2 logs 

    to exit the logs use 

        ctrl + c
